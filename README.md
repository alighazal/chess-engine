# Chess Engine

This is a Chess Engine project ( dah! ) written in Java.

Aside from the joy of programming itself, the aim of the project
is exploring intelligent systems. this is just the first step where I am exploring rule based systems.
Hopefully in the future I would work on Neural Networks Based systems.
